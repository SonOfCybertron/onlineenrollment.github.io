            <p>If you encounter technical difficulties while using the online-based enrollment system, the first step is to try and troubleshoot the issue by reviewing any error messages or prompts that appear on the screen. If you are unable to resolve the issue on your own, you should contact the technical support team for the enrollment system or the educational institution or program that you are trying to enroll in.
<br>
When contacting technical support, be prepared to provide detailed information about the issue you are experiencing, including any error messages or screenshots of the problem. They may be able to provide you with guidance on how to resolve the issue or escalate it to their technical team for further investigation.
<br>
It is also a good idea to keep track of any correspondence or communication with the technical support team in case you need to refer back to it later on.</p>

          </label>
          <div class="sub-content">
            <p>The ability to make changes to an enrollment application after submission may vary depending on the specific online-based enrollment system and the policies of the educational institution or program. In some cases, you may be able to log back into the system and edit certain information, such as your contact information or program preferences. However, once an application has been reviewed and processed, it may not be possible to make changes to certain parts of the application, such as academic records or test scores.

It is important to carefully review your application before submitting it to ensure that all information is accurate and complete. If you need to make changes after submission, you should contact the enrollment office or admissions department for guidance on how to proceed. They may be able to advise you on whether changes are possible and what steps you need to take to update your application.</p>
